## üìä Production-Ready Sample Data üéØ

NewsFlow comes with **complete production-ready fixtures** perfect for impressing recruiters and demonstrating AI capabilities:

### Complete Dataset Included
- **31 real news sources** from major publications
- **567 actual articles** scraped from live feeds
- **Full categorization** and metadata
- **AI recommendation data** with user interactions
- **User profiles** with realistic preferences

### Already Loaded!
If you followed the setup instructions above, you already have a fully populated database ready for demonstration. No additional setup required!

### What This Gives You
- **Immediate impressive demo** - Launch and show a fully functional news platform
- **AI recommendations working** - Real user interaction data powers the ML algorithms
- **Complete content coverage** - Articles across Technology, Business, Politics, Sports, Entertainment, Health, Science, World News, and Environment
- **Professional appearance** - Real content from recognizable sources like BBC, CNN, TechCrunch, Reuters, etc.

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. **Email verification is optional** - you can use the account immediately after signup for easy demo purposes.

- **Sample users included**: The fixtures provide 6 demo users (including 1 admin) ready for testing AI recommendations

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    uv run mypy newsflow

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    uv run coverage run -m pytest
    uv run coverage html
    uv run open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    uv run pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2-local-development/developing-locally.html#using-webpack-or-gulp).

### Celery

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

```bash
cd newsflow
uv run celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info
```

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important _where_ the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with _manage.py_, you should be right.

To run [periodic tasks](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html), you'll need to start the celery beat scheduler service. You can start it as a standalone process:

```bash
cd newsflow
uv run celery -A config.celery_app beat
```

or you can embed the beat service inside a worker with the `-B` option (not recommended for production use):

```bash
cd newsflow
uv run celery -A config.celery_app worker -B -l info
```

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. If you choose to use [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) when generating the project a local SMTP server with a web interface will be available.

1.  [Download the latest Mailpit release](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/releases) for your OS.

2.  Copy the binary file to the project root.

3.  Make it executable:

        chmod +x mailpit

4.  Spin up another terminal window and start it there:

        ./mailpit

5.  Check out <http://127.0.0.1:8025/> to see how it goes.

Now you have your own mail server running locally, ready to receive whatever you send it.
